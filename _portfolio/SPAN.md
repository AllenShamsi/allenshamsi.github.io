## What it is
**SPAN** is a cross-platform desktop application for interactive analysis and visualization of speech production data. It is designed primarily for **electromagnetic articulography (EMA)** research, integrating synchronized articulatory kinematics, acoustic signals, and gesture-based annotations within a single, unified interface.

SPAN supports exploratory data analysis, manual and semi-automatic annotation, and template-based gesture alignment using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The tool is built to facilitate research on speech motor control, articulatory phonology, and speech perception–production links, while remaining flexible enough for teaching, demonstrations, and method development.

## Highlights
- Synchronized waveform / spectrogram / EMA trajectories with shared cursor
- Gesture & landmark annotation workflows
- Template alignment using DTW, including multi-anchor support
- 3D sensor visualization for articulator motion inspection

## Links
- GitHub repo: TBD
- Demo data (optional): TBD

## Status
SPAN is under active development.
