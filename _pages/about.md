Greetings! I am a PhD candidate in [Linguistics at the University of Florida](https://lin.ufl.edu/), working with Dr. Ratree Wayland. I study speech production and perception, with a particular interest in how linguistic representations are translated into coordinated speech movements. My work uses articulatory and acoustic methods, including electromagnetic articulography (EMA), to examine speech motor learning, coordination, and variability in both native and second-language speech.

I received my B.A. in Linguistics (*summa cum laude*) from the University of Florida in 2019. My research is grounded in experimental, data-driven approaches to articulatory and acoustic phonetics, and my work has appeared in journals such as *The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America*, *Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research*, *Applied Psycholinguistics*, and *Brain Sciences*. My current research is supported by a [National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/show-award?AWD_ID=2518936), which funds my dissertation on perception–production relationships in non-native sequence acquisition.

Alongside my research, I am committed to teaching and mentorship. I have served as Instructor of Record for Introduction to Linguistics and Introduction to Public Speaking at the University of Florida, and previously worked as a teaching assistant in phonetics and communication courses.

Outside of academia, I enjoy hiking and reading Russian poetry.
